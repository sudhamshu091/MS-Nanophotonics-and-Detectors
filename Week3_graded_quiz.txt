What is the minimum optical power required to ensure a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 dB at 20 Hz (bandwidth) at 900 nm? Your answer should be in \muμW.
Ans:5.366   (explaination:NEP(900nm)*sqrt(20)*e8=5.366*e-6)
2.Question 2
What is the minimum optical power required to ensure a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 dB at 20 Hz at 450 nm? Your answer should be in \muμW.
Ans:10.732  (explaination:2*NEP(900nm)sqrt(20)*e8=10.732*e-6)
3.Question 3
